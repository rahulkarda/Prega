# How to set up local environment

## 1. Clone Repo or Download Files


So, first of all you need to do is clone the [Clueless-Community/prega](https://github.com/Clueless-Community/prega) GitHub repository or you can also download the files.


If you don't know how to clone or where to download the code the watch this video.

[How to Clone a GitHub Repo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKcqniGu3tA)
[Blog on the same topic, official GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)

Or you can run this code in your PC/Laptop terminal 

```
git clone https://github.com/Clueless-Community/prega.git
```

Move to prega folder
```
cd prega
```

## 2. Get all the required dependencies

Run the command to generate the Asset file to run the app in your local system

```
flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

example use:
```
Assets.icons.icon.image(height: 45),
```
in place of :
```
 Image.asset(
             'assets/icons/icon.png',
             height: 45,
             width: 45,
           ),
```

## 3. Generate all assets code

Run the command to get all the required dependencies to run the app in your local system

```
flutter pub get
```

## Run the app
You can run the app either on Virtual device or on a real physical device

Watch the video if you don't know how to do it.

[How to run app on physical device](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aohkII1C4JY)

**Before running the app** make sure you add the google-services.json to the ```android/app``` folder
